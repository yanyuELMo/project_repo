# Accident Detection with TU-DAT (DTU 02476 MLOps)

This repository contains our course project for **DTU 02476 — Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)**.
The goal is to build an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for a practical computer vision task: **road traffic accident detection from roadside videos**.

Data source:https://github.com/pavana27/TU-DAT
> In this course, we focus on building a reliable ML system (training → evaluation → deployment → monitoring).
